# ðŸš€ Space Shooter

A top-down 2D space shooter game built in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), inspired by [The Net Ninjaâ€™s Godot4 tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iHCXBpxbdsOByZ55Ez4bgF).  
This project expands upon the original tutorial by adding new features, polish, and gameplay enhancements.
